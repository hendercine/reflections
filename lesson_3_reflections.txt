You can use a remote repository instead of a local one when you need to
collaborate with other people or access your repository on multiple computers.

You might want to always pull changes manually rather than have Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository because you never know
whether or not your local repository may be ahead or behind the remote and you
may lose changes that were made locally.

The differences between Forks, Clones and Branches are that Forks are a feature
of GitHub that allow to clone another author's repository and work on it as
though it were your own, while also giving them credit as the original author.
Cloning could achieve this but attibution would have to be given manually and
failure to do so could invite accusations of plagarism. A Branch is a is an off-
shoot within a repository and without full push permission, you could never
merge your branches with a remote.
