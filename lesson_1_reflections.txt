Viewing a diff between two versions of a file really helped me see the bug that
was introduced. I wish I had known about this method sooner.

Having easy access to the entire history of a file cold have huge impact on
efficiency as a programmer in the long term because it could help one identify
common recurring mistakes that one makes and allow one to quickly debug problems
with one's code.

The pros of manually choosing when to create a commit in git are that you can
managae the size of the commits and make sure they are logical. The cons are
that this is prone to user error and musch less convienient if you forget to
commit.

Some VCSs, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit because they are
designed to work with programming files, which often have multiple, inter-
related files involved. Others, like Google Docs, are more for more typical
files and documents that stand alone and do not have other files connected to
them that affect their output.

Using version control might make you so much more confident in making changes
that could break something, because you know that you can not only revert to
previous versions but also find out exactly what mistake was made when.

I'm eager to eventually try using Git to track my next nanodegree work.
