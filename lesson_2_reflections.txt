When you initialize a repository a hidden file is created called .git that is
needed to keep track of your commits and other meta-data that is required to
maintain version control.

The Staging Area is different from the Working Directory and the Repository
because it does just what its name suggests; it stages files that are to be
committed from the WorkDir into the Repo. This has great value in that you can
make changes to multiple files but then ultimately add them to the same commit
when they are logically connected to each other.
