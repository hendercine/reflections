You can use a remote repository instead of a local one when you need to
collaborate with other people or access your repository on multiple computers.

You might want to always pull changes manually rather than have Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository because you never know
whether or not your local repository may be ahead or behind the remote and you
may lose changes that were made locally.
