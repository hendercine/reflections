When you initialize a repository a hidden file is created called .git that is
needed to keep track of your commits and other meta-data that is required to
maintain version control.

The Staging Area is different from the Working Directory and the Repository
because it does just what its name suggests; it stages files that are to be
committed from the WorkDir into the Repo. This has great value in that you can
make changes to multiple files but then ultimately add them to the same commit
when they are logically connected to each other.

You can use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change with the git diff and git --staged commands. If you've modified
multiple files that are different logical changes, you can stage the first one
and move onto the next file. When you're finished with the second file you can
run git diff --staged to see which files are already staged and git diff to
see which are not. This allows you to quickly see and organize your logical
separation of commits.
